Guinevere rides on Mondays
Arthur rides
Guinevere rides the old white horse near the castle on Mondays
when Arthur drinks beer Guinevere sighs
Guinevere thinks Arthur drinks water
Arthur rides near the castle and drinks from the chalice
Arthur rides and drinks beer and water
when do Arthur and Guinevere drink beer
when does Guinevere ride
horses love drinking water
Arthur may have loved Guinevere
Arthur gives Guinevere the horse
what does Arthur give Guinevere
whom does Guinevere give the horse
whom do Guinevere and Arthur give the horse
what does Guinevere drink
whom does Guinevere think Arthur gives the horse
what does Guinevere think Arthur drinks
Guinevere loves Arthur and rides the horse
when Guinevere rides the horse and drinks water from the chalice Arthur drinks beer near the castle
the white horses sigh when Arthur drinks water
the horse drank water
Arthur thought of beer
does Arthur think
