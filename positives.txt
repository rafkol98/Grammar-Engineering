Arthur loves Guinevere
Guinevere sighs
Guinevere and Arthur sigh
horses drink water
Arthur rides the horse
Guinevere rides on Mondays
Arthur rides
Guinevere rides the old white horse near the castle on Mondays
when Arthur drinks beer Guinevere sighs
Guinevere thinks Arthur drinks water
Arthur rides near the castle and drinks from the chalice
Arthur rides and drinks beer and water
when do Arthur and Guinevere drink beer
when does Guinevere ride
