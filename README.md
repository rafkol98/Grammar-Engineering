# Grammar Engineering Coursework

This repository contains the materials and code for my Grammar Engineering coursework from the Language and Computation module - MSc in Artificial Intelligence, University of St Andrews. The coursework focuses on developing and testing a context-free grammar (CFG) for a subset of English, later extended to include number agreement and subcategorization.

The PDF file (`Language - Practical 2.pdf`) contains my full analysis, including hand-drawn syntax trees, implemented grammar rules, and reflections.

## Overview

The coursework involved the following tasks:
1. **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)**: Develop a CFG to parse simple English sentences.
2. **Number Agreement**: Extend the grammar to enforce agreement between noun and verb phrases.
3. **Subcategorization**: Include rules specifying valid argument structures for verbs to eliminate overgeneration of ungrammatical sentences.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Test the grammar using positive and negative sentences, including complex conditional and interrogative structures.

## Key Features

- Support for declarative, conditional, and interrogative sentence structures.
- Recursive rules for handling nested phrases and multiple adjectives.
- Subcategorization for verbs to prevent overgeneration.
- Dynamic handling of singular/plural agreement for nouns and verbs.
